# Portfolio_August

## Description

This project is a portfolio of my work to showcase my skills to employers and clients looking to fill a part-time, a full-time position or free-lance work. This portfolio demonstrated my skillset in flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. Throught the process I learned how to include various CSS tags as well as how to add icons using a JavaScript code pulled from fontawesome.com
